    "## A Fun and Easy problem about Geyser Eruptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carolyn P. Johnston, March 6, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "Husband and Grown Children went off for a drive somewhere, and when they came back, they were arguing about how to solve the following problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "*There are 3 geysers: A, B, and C. Geyser A erupts every 2 hours; B, every 4 hours; and C, every 6 hours. The geysers erupt independently (as far as we know).*  \n",
    "\n",
    "*You arrive at the geysers, with no knowledge of when any of them last erupted. What is the probability that A will erupt before both B and C?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I first tried to work out an analytic solution, and then used a simulation to check my work. After several tries at calculating the integral and getting results that didn't match the simulation's (the integral was different every time -- not a good sign), I finally calculated the integral correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to be able to blame Probability or at least Calculus, but Arithmetic was actually at fault. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The analytic solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The time until next eruption of A, $t_A$, is modeled with $U_A$, a uniform distribution over $[0,2]$; $t_B$, as $U_B$ = Uniform $[0,4]$; $t_C$, as $U_C$ = Uniform$[0,6]$. The events of A, B, and C erupting are assumed to be independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the eruption events are independent, the joint probability is given by the product of the individual pdfs:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Geyser-eq1.png \"Equation 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (originally) $$P(t_A < a, t_B < b, t_C < c) = \\int_0^a \\int_0^b\\int_0^c U_A(a)U_B(b)U_C(c) \\cdot da \\cdot db \\cdot dc.$$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability we are interested in is that of the event that $t_A < t_B$ and $t_A < t_C$. This is given by the integral: \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Geyser-eq2.png \"Equation 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (originally)  $$\\int_0^2 \\int_a^4\\int_a^6 U_A(a)\\cdot U_B(b)\\cdot U_C(c) \\cdot da \\cdot db \\cdot dc = $$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (originally)  $$\\frac{1}{48} \\int_0^2 \\left\\{\\int_a^4 db \\cdot \\int_a^6 dc\\right\\} \\cdot da = \\frac{1}{48} \\int_0^2 (4-a)\\cdot(6-a) \\cdot da = \\frac{1}{48} \\cdot [\\frac{56}{3} + 12] = 0.63888.....$$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The simulation in R\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll simulate N draws from these distributions, where N is a Really Large Number, and look at the frequency of the event of interest (A erupting before both B and C). \n",
    "\n",
    "The value you get from the simulation with N=100,000 is within a couple of thousandths of the closed-form solution. To get any closer than that, the computer has to work a little.\n"
