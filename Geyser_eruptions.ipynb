    "## Geyser Eruptions and Fisher Information\n",

    "### Carolyn P. Johnston, March 6, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "Over Christmas vacation, Husband and Grown Children went off for a drive somewhere, and when they came back, they were arguing about how to solve the following problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "*There are 3 geysers: A, B, and C. Geyser A erupts every 2 hours; B, every 4 hours; and C, every 6 hours. The geysers erupt independently (as far as we know).*  \n",
    "\n",
    "*You arrive at the geysers, with no knowledge of when any of them last erupted. What is the probability that A will erupt before both B and C?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of family harmony at Christmas, I got right to work settling the issue. I worked out a closed-form solution, and then used a Monte Carlo simulation to check my work. After several tries at calculating the integral and getting results that didn't match the simulation's (the integral was different every time I worked it out -- not a good sign), I finally calculated the integral correctly (I'd like to be able to blame Probability or at least Calculus, but Arithmetic was actually at fault).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The analytic solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The time until next eruption of A, $t_A$, is modeled with $U_A$, a uniform distribution over $[0,2]$; $t_B$, as $U_B$ = Uniform $[0,4]$; $t_C$, as $U_C$ = Uniform$[0,6]$. The events of A, B, and C erupting are assumed to be independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the eruption events are independent, the joint probability is given by the product of the individual pdfs:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Geyser-eq1.png \"Equation 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (originally) $$P(t_A < a, t_B < b, t_C < c) = \\int_0^a \\int_0^b\\int_0^c U_A(a)U_B(b)U_C(c) \\cdot da \\cdot db \\cdot dc.$$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability we are interested in is that of the event that $t_A < t_B$ and $t_A < t_C$. This is given by the integral: \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Geyser-eq2.png \"Equation 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- (originally)  $$\\int_0^2 \\int_a^4\\int_a^6 U_A(a)\\cdot U_B(b)\\cdot U_C(c) \\cdot da \\cdot db \\cdot dc = $$ -->\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The simulation in R\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the time until next eruption of A, $t_A$, is a uniform distribution over $[0,2]$; $t_B$ is Uniform $[0,4]$; $t_C$ is Uniform$[0,6]$, and the $t_i$ for $i=A,B,C$ are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "I simulated $N$ draws from these distributions, and look at the frequency of the event of interest (A erupting before both B and C, or $t_A < t_B$ and $t_A < t_C$).\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a little disappointed that with $N=100000$ draws, I only get these estimated probability to the order of a thousandth."
